Test Scenario 1: Successful Email Sending
- Given that I have a valid email address, when I call the sendEmail function with that email, then the function should return success message.

Test Scenario 2: Email Field is Blank
- Given that I have an email field left blank, when I call the sendEmail function with that blank field, then the function should handle this scenario in business logic and it might not be successful.

Test Scenario 3: Email Field is Null
- Given that the email field is null, when I call the sendEmail function with a null value, then the function should handle this scenario in business logic properly.

Test Scenario 4: Email Address is not Valid
- Given that I have an invalid email address which doesn't comply with standard email address format, when I call the sendEmail function with that email, then the function should handle this scenario in business logic properly.

Test Scenario 5: Email contains special characters
- Given that the email contains special characters, when I call the sendEmail function with that email, then the function should handle this scenario properly.

Test Scenario 6 - Email sent to multiple recipients
- Given that I have multiple valid email addresses, when I call the sendEmail function with those email addresses, then the function should be able to handle this scenario properly.

These are some basic scenarios, but the exact cases would depend on business logic implementation within the function. Note that these scenarios assume the function "sendEmail" includes some sort of validation and error handling functionality not shown in the provided code snippet.
